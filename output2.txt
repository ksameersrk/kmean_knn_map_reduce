Gender: We have represented Male with 0 and Female with 1. So, 0.5 is the correct division for the labelling.
Male <= 0.5
Female > 0.5

Age: Range is between 18 to 60. Based on the Common age grouping, labelling them as Junior, Adult and Senior.
Junior < 25
25=< Adult < 40
Senior  >= 40

Income: 35%, 45% and 10%. I have used this distribution because in general there are less people in top of the chain.
Poor < 50
50 <= Average < 85
Rich >= 90

Spending: Following the Income trend.
Low < 40
40 <= Medium < 80
High >= 82


Remarks: After labelling we can see that there are many catagories in the Female gender compared to Male Gender.
